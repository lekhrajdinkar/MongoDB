***
### features
1. `Performance`
2. `NO SQL` DATABASE solution.
> - Different philosopy. SQL approach normalized/distrbutes into multiple table.
> - Mongo stores as much as data in single `Collection`

3.  High level picture: Database > collection (like table) > document (like data)

4. `Flexible`
> - Can store/fetch `nested` data effectively in JSON. no complex join among multiple tables exits here.
> - Stores data in JSON format. Not exactly JSON but binary form of JSON - BSON.
